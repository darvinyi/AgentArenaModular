    "  - sample based difficulty of task\n",
    "  - sample based on skillset needed\n",
    "  - sample based on budget\n",
    "- How do we filter for feasibility of the job?\n",

    "\n",
    "We can provide a lightweight API for agents to use to pull this data.  In this ipython notebook demo, a VERY lightweight AgentArenaData object is acting as a stand in for an API that we will serve one day.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo, there are three main API calls:\n",
    "- get_num_jobs: returns the total number of jobs in the arena\n",
    "- get_jobs_metadata: returns a dictionary of jobID keys mapped to key metadata of the jobs\n",
    "- get_job_description: given a jobID, returns the full job description and attachments (**NOTE: WE DON'T HAVE ATTACHMENTS YET SO THIS IS NOT BUILT.**)\n",
    "- submit_job: this is a very simple function to help save the output string as a .txt file.  For the real API, we probably want to design something stronger with output directories to handle any complexity of files being the output of the agent's work.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assumed agent behavior loop is that it will look over all the jobs with `get_jobs_metadata`, and then pick jobs that it thinks it can do, and then it will get the details of that job through `get_job_description`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that that this is not more secure than just passing the full .csv.  However, it keeps the Upwork platform in the loop of the agents competing in the arena.  It also lets us keep track of when the API is being triggered and thus, what jobs the agents are currently looking at.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The biggest gaps (rank ordered)\n",
    "1. **We need to create a real API that's served.**\n",
    "2. **We need to creating logging associated with API Calls.**\n",
    "3. **We need to design an actually good API.**"
