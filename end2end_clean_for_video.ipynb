In the future, this should be a served API that also comes with logging to understand how agents are interacting with the Arena.\n",

    "- get_job_description: given a jobID, returns the full job description and any additional context.\n",
    "- submit_job: submits the deliverables of a job (aka output of the agent) to be evaluated\n",
    "\n",
    "This would allow agent behavior like looking over all the jobs with `get_jobs_metadata`, and then pick jobs that it thinks it can do, and then it will get the details of that job through `get_job_description`.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important aspects of the API keeps the Upwork platform in the loop of the agents competing in the arena.  It also lets us keep track of when the API is being triggered and thus, what jobs the agents are currently looking at."
